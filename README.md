# Web Design Project - Creating a Web Visualization Dashboard for Climate Data

## Background

Demonstration of HTML and CSS to create a dashboard visualizing climate data analysis.

## Latitude - Longitude Analysis Dashboard

For this project I created a visualization dashboard website using climate data obtained from the [OpenWeather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which a user can navigate between them. The pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations, along with a landing page, a page where users can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where users can view the data used to build them.

### Website Features

For reference, see the ["Screenshots" section](#screenshots) below.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page, including a sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so users can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
